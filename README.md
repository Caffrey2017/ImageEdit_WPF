# Basic image processing program

A simple image processing program made with *C#* and *WPF* containg a large amount of algorithms to test.
Currently supports the following file formats:

- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- BMP


### Algorithms

- Shift bits
- Threshold
- Auto threshold
- Negative
- Square root
- Contrast enhancement
- Brightness
- Contrast
- Histogram
- Image summarization
- Image subtraction
- Image convolution (Sobel, Gaussian Blur, Sharpen)
- Image equalization [RGB]
- Image equalization [HSV]
- Image equalization [YUV]


### TODO

- [ ] Color to Grayscale algorithm
- [ ] Better encoder (I used Magick.NET but I have to deal with some problems to use it again)
- [X] Undo/Redo system
  - [ ] Key shortcuts
- [ ] Convolution kernels: double, int
- [ ] Check sum of kernel windows
- [ ] Progress bar on every algorithm window
- [ ] Preferences window
- [ ] Documentation of the source code

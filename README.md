# Basic image processing program

A simple image processing program containg a large amount of algorithms to test. Currently supoports *JPEG*/*JPG*, *PNG* and *BMP* image file formats.
*RAW* file format are not supported for now.


## Algorithms

* Shift bits
* Threshold
* Auto threshold
* Negative
* Square root
* Contrast enhancement
* Brightness
* Contrast
* Histogram
* Image summarization
* Image subtraction
* Image convolution (Sobel, Gaussian Blur, Sharpen)
* Image equalization [RGB]
* Image equalization [HSV]
* Image equalization [YUV]


## TODO

* Color to grayscale conversion
* Better encoder... (I used Magick.NET but I have to deal with some problems to use it again)
* Undo/Redo system

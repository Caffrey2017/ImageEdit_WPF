# Basic image processing program

A simple image processing program made with *C#* and *WPF* containg a large amount of algorithms to test. Currently supports **JPEG*/**JPG**, **PNG** and **BMP** image file formats.
**RAW** file format are not supported for now.


### Algorithms

* Shift bits
* Threshold
* Auto threshold
* Negative
* Square root
* Contrast enhancement
* Brightness
* Contrast
* Histogram
* Image summarization
* Image subtraction
* Image convolution (Sobel, Gaussian Blur, Sharpen)
* Image equalization [RGB]
* Image equalization [HSV]
* Image equalization [YUV]


### TODO

- [ ] Color to grayscale conversion
- [ ] Better encoder... (I used Magick.NET but I have to deal with some problems to use it again)
- [ ] Undo/Redo system
